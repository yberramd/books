#### The GNU C Library Reference Manual

File: `The_GNU_C_Library_Reference_Manual.pdf`

The GNU C Library, described in this document, defines all of the library functions that are specified by the ISO C standard, as well as additional features specific to POSIX and other derivatives of the Unix operating system, and extensions specific to GNU systems.

The purpose of this manual is to tell how to use the facilities of the GNU C Library.

#### How Computers Work - Processor and Main Memory

File `HowComputerWorks.pdf`

For in-depth knowldge on how computers work. No technical knowledge is required.
It explains the operation of a simple, but fully functional, computer in complete detail.
The simple computer described consists mainly of a processor and main memory.
Relays, which are explained, are used in the circuitry instead of transistors for simplicity.
This book does not cover peripherals like modems, mice, disk drives, or monitors.

#### Structured Computer Organization

File: `Structured_Computer_Organization.pdf`

This book approach computers with the idea that a computer can be regarded as a hierarchy of levels, each one performing some well-defined function.
The digital logic level, the microarchitecture level, the instruction set architecture level, the operating system machine level, and the assembly language level are all discussed in detail.
